## My Process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

After doing this challenge I have learned many things about dom manipulation. before I learned dom from tutorials but with this project I practiced my learning. now I became a little bit more confident working with the Dom.


### Continued development

To incorporate the conditional on ratings, if a higher number is initially chosen and subsequently the decision is made to lower the rating, the active state should also decrease to the selected number.
